# 🎯 Regime-Switching RL Portfolio Manager

**Adaptive portfolio allocation through reinforcement learning and dynamic market regime awareness.**

---

## ✨ Project Overview

**Regime-Switching RL Portfolio Manager** is an innovative application of reinforcement learning in finance, designed to dynamically adjust asset allocations based on real-time market conditions — bull, bear, or sideways.  
Instead of assuming constant market behavior, it embraces structural shifts, improving responsiveness during volatility spikes, rallies, and downturns.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- 📈 **Market Regime Detection**: Automatic classification via RSI and MACD indicators.
- 🧠 **Custom RL Environment**: Combines historical returns with regime flags.
- 🤖 **Adaptive RL Agent**: PPO-based model trained for dynamic buy/hold/sell decisions.
- ⚡ **Lightweight Training**: CPU-optimized using free historical Yahoo Finance data.
- 🎯 **Risk-Return Optimization**: Learns to balance profits against volatility over time.

## 🚀 How It Works

- **Environment Setup**: Recent returns window + market regime flags.
- **Learning Phase**: PPO agent optimizes policy based on profits and risk management.
- **Adaptation**: Strategic allocation shifts during different market regimes.
